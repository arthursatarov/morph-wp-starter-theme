/// Animation Token Definitions
///
/// This file defines the animation system for the design system based on
/// systematic motion design principles. The system includes duration scales,
/// easing functions categorized by usage type (productive vs expressive),
/// and choreography delays for multi-object animations.
///
/// Motion Principles:
/// - Productive: Quick, functional movements for frequent interactions
/// - Expressive: Delightful, personality-driven movements for key moments
/// - Focus: Direct user attention to important elements
/// - Inform: Provide context and spatial awareness

  1.0 DURATION (Timing Scales)

/// Duration scale for animations and transitions
/// Following t-shirt sizing: faster movements for smaller objects/distances,
/// slower movements for larger objects/complex choreography
///
/// Usage Guidelines:
/// - 100/200: Small components (buttons, icons, tooltips) 100-200ms
/// - 200/300: Standard transitions (cards, modals) 200-300ms
/// - 500/700: Page transitions, complex choreography 500-700ms

/// Timing functions organized by motion principle

/// Productive: Quick, functional movements for frequent interactions
/// - Use for: closing states, utility animations, work-focused UI
/// - Character: Linear, efficient, minimal deceleration
///
/// Expressive: Delightful, personality-driven movements
/// - Use for: entrance states, brand moments, first-time interactions
/// - Character: Springy, playful, noticeable deceleration

/// Delay values for staggered animations and choreography
/// Use for: sequencing multiple objects, creating rhythm

/// Choreography Guidelines:
/// - 2-3 objects: Use 'sm' delays (50-100ms stagger)
/// - 4-8 objects: Use 'md' delays with 'lg' total duration
/// - Consider accessibility: offer reduced motion settings

  USAGE CONTEXT
====================================================== */
/// Context-based animation recommendations:
///
/// BUTTONS & CONTROLS (Productive):
/// - Duration: 100-150ms
/// - Easing: productive/standard
/// - Example: @include transition(background-color, xs, productive-standard);
///
/// MODALS & OVERLAYS (Mixed):
/// - Entrance: md + expressive/enter (250ms, personality)
/// - Exit: sm + productive/exit (150ms, quick dismiss)
///
/// CARDS & COMPONENTS (Expressive):
/// - Duration: sm-md (150-250ms)
/// - Easing: expressive/standard
/// - Example: @include transition(transform, sm, expressive-standard);
///
/// PAGE TRANSITIONS (Expressive):
/// - Duration: lg-xl (350-500ms)
/// - Easing: expressive/enter
/// - Choreography: Use delays for staggered content
///
/// FOCUS & ATTENTION (Fast):
/// - Duration: xs (100ms)
/// - Easing: productive/standard
/// - Use for highlighting, pulsing, drawing attention
///
/// TOOLTIPS & POPOVERS (Productive):
/// - Entrance: sm + expressive/enter (subtle presence)
/// - Exit: xs + productive/exit (instant dismiss)
